Knowing only the commands and arguments is not enough for solving problems we face while using git. Understandin the structure is necessary - what this book tries to explain, in addition to describing various commands with examples.

I recommend this book not only to beginners but also to all who want to know how exactly various git features like commit, branching, merge , etc works, to all who want to understand the git well!
